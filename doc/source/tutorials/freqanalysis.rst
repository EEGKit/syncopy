Spectral Analysis
=================

Many signals in Neuroscience have oscillatory components, and hence an analysis in the *frequency domain* often is advised. The high-level function :func:`~syncopy.freqanalysis` offers many standard methods for spectral analysis, like multi-tapered Fourier transform or time-frequency methods like wavelet transforms. In the following we introduce each method individually:
