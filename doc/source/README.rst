Welcome to the Documentation of SyNCoPy!
========================================

SyNCoPy (**Sy**\stems **N**\euroscience **Co**\mputing in **Py**\thon, spelled Syncopy in the following)
is a Python toolkit for user-friendly, large-scale electrophysiology data analysis.
We strive to achieve the following goals:

1. Syncopy provides a full *open source* Python environment for reproducible
   electrophysiology data analysis.
2. Syncopy is *scalable* to accommodate *very large* datasets. It automatically
   makes use of available computing resources and is developed with built-in
   parallelism in mind.
3. Syncopy is *compatible* with the MATLAB toolbox `FieldTrip <http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/>`_.
