Selections
***********

Basically every practical data analysis project involves working on subsets of the data. Syncopy offers the powerful :func:`~syncopy.selectdata` function to achieve exactly that. There are two distinct ways to apply a selection, either *in-place* or the chosen subset gets copied and returned as a new Syncopy data object. Additionally, every Syncopy *meta-function* (see :ref:`meta_functions`) supports the ``select`` keyword, which applies an in place selection on the fly when processing data.

Selections are an important concept of Syncopy and are being re-used *under the hood* for plotting functions like :func:`~syncopy.singlepanelplot` and also for :func:`~syncopy.show`. Both plotting and numpy array extraction naturally operate on subsets of the data, and conveniently use the same selection criteria syntax as :func:`~syncopy.selectdata`.

Creating Selections
===================

Syncopy data objects can be best understood as n-dimensional arrays or matrices, with each dimension holding a certain property of the data. For an :class:`~syncopy.AnalogData` object these dimensions would be ``time``, ``channel`` and ``trials``. Now we can define sub-slices of the data by combining index sets for each of those axes.

A new selection can be created by calling :func:`~syncopy.selectdata`, here we want to select a single trial and two channels::

  trial10 = AData.selectdata(trials=10, channel=["channel11", "channel17"])
  # alternatively
  trial10 = spy.selectdata(AData, trials=10, channel=["channel02", "channel06"])

``AData`` is an :class:`~syncopy.AnalogData` object, and hence the resulting
``trial10`` data object will also be of that same data type. Inspecting the original
dataset by simply typing its name into the Python interpreter::

  AData

we see that we have 100 trials and 10 channels:
  
.. code-block:: bash


   Syncopy AnalogData object with fields

            cfg : dictionary with keys ''
        channel : [10] element <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
      container : None
           data : 100 trials of length 500.0 defined on [50000 x 10] float32 Dataset of size 1.91 MB
       ...

If we now inspect our selection results::

  trial10

we see that we are left with 1 trial and 2 channels:

.. code-block:: bash


   Syncopy AnalogData object with fields

            cfg : dictionary with keys ''
        channel : [2] element <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
      container : None
           data : 1 trials of length 500.0 defined on [500 x 2] float32 Dataset of size 0.00 MB
       ...


As we did not specify any selection criteria for the time axis (via ``latency``) every sample was selected. This is true in general: whenever a certain dimension has no selection specification the complete axis is selected.

Finally by inspecting the ``.log`` (see also :ref:`logging`) we can see the selection settings used to create this dataset::

  trials10.log

.. code-block:: bash
  
	write_log: computed _selectdata with settings
	inplace = False
	clear = False
	latency=None	
	trials = 10
	channel = ['channel02', 'channel06']

This log is persistent, meaning that when saving and later loading this reduced dataset the settings used for this selection can still be recovered. The table below summarizes all possible selection parameters and their availability for each datatype.

.. _selections_table:

Table of Selection Parameters
=============================

There are various selection parameters
available, which each can accept a variety of Python datatypes like ``int``, ``str`` or ``list``. Some selection parameters are only available for data types which have the corresponding dimension, like ``frequency`` for ``SpectralData`` and ``CrossSpectralData``.

Inplace Selections
==================

An in-place selection can be understood as a mask being put onto the data. Meaning that the selected subset of the data is actually **not copied on disc**, but the selection criteria are applied *in place* to be used in a processing step. Inplace selections take two forms: either explicit via the ``inplace`` keyword ``selectdata(..., inplace=True)``, or implicit by passing a ``select`` keyword to a Syncopy meta-function.

To illustrate this mechanic, let's create a simulated dataset with :func:`~syncopy.tests.synth_data.phase_diffusion` and compute the coherence for the full dataset:

.. literalinclude:: /scripts/select_example.py

.. image:: /_static/select_example1.png
   :height: 220px

Phase diffusing signals decorrelate over time, hence if we wait long enough we can't see any coherence.

.. note::
   As an exercise you could use :func:`~syncopy.freqanalysis` to confirm that there is indeed strong oscillatory activity in the 40Hz band

Explicit inplace Selection
--------------------------

To see if maybe for a shorter time period in the beginning of "the recording" the signals were actually more phase locked, we can use an **in-place latency selection**::

  # note there is no return value here
  spy.selectdata(adata, latency=[-1, 0], inplace=True)
  
Inspecting the dataset:

.. code-block:: bash


    Syncopy AnalogData object with fields

                cfg : dictionary with keys 'selectdata'
            channel : [2] element <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
          container : None
               data : 100 trials defined on [50000 x 3] float64 Dataset of size 1.14 MB
             dimord : time by channel
           filename : /home/whir/.spy/spy_3e83_a9c8b544.analog
               info : dictionary with keys ''
               mode : r+
         sampleinfo : [100 x 2] element <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
         samplerate : 200.0
          selection : Syncopy AnalogData selector with all channels, 201 times, 100 trials
                tag : None
               time : 100 element list
          trialinfo : [100 x 0] element <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
     trialintervals : [100 x 2] element <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
             trials : 100 element iterable


we can see that now the ``selection`` entry is filled with information, telling us we selected 201 time points.

With that selection being active, let's repeat the connectivity analysis::

  # coherence with active in-place selection
  coh2 = spy.connectivityanalysis(adata, method='coh')

  # plot coherence of channel1 vs channel2
  coh2.singlepanelplot(channel_i='channel1', channel_j='channel2')

.. image:: /_static/select_example2.png
   :height: 220px

Indeed, we now see some coherence around the 40Hz band.

Finally, let's **wipe the inplace selection** before continuing::

  # inspect active inplace selection
  adata.selection
  >>> Syncopy AnalogData selector with all channels, 201 times, 100 trials
  
  # wipe selection
  adata.selection = None

Inplace selection via ``select`` keyword
----------------------------------------

Alternatively, we can also give a dictionary of selection parameters directly to every Syncopy meta-function. These will then internally apply an inplace selection before performing the analysis::

  # coherence only for selected time points
  coh3 = spy.connectivityanalysis(adata, method='coh', select={'latency': [-1, 0]})

  # plot coherence of channel1 vs channel2
  coh3.singlepanelplot(channel_i='channel1', channel_j='channel2')

.. image:: /_static/select_example2.png
   :height: 220px

Hopefully not surprisingly we get to exactly the same result as with an explicit in-place selection above. The difference here however is, that after the analysis is done, there is no active in-place selection present::

  adata.selection is None
  >>> True

Hence, it's important to note that implicit selections **get wiped automatically** after an analysis.

In the end it is up to the user to decide which way of applying selections is most practical in their situation.

Relation to :func:`~syncopy.show` and :func:`~syncopy.singlepanelplot`
======================================================================

As hinted on in the beginning of this chapter, both plotting and numpy array extraction adhere to the same syntax as :func:`~syncopy.selectdata`. Meaning that the following two arrays hold the same data::

  # First explicitly select a subset
  trial10 = spy.selectdata(AData, trials=10, channel=["channel02", "channel06"])
  # show everything of the subset
  # WARNING: don't do this with large datasets!
  arr1 = trial10.show()

  # calling show() with the same selection
  # criteria directly on the original complete dataset
  arr2 = AData.show(trials=10, channel=["channel02", "channel06"])

  # this is True!
  arr1 == arr2

And in the same spirit, both plotting commands below will produce the same figure::

  # First explicitly select a subset   
  trial10 = spy.selectdata(AData, trials=10, channel=["channel02", "channel06"])
  # plot everything: only 1 trial and 2 channels left
  trial10.singlepanelplot()

  # directly plot from full data set with same selection criteria
  AData.singlepanelplot(trials=10, channel=["channel02", "channel06"])

This works *under the hood* by applying temporary in-place selections onto the data before plotting and/or extracting the numpy arrays.
